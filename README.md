This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

note to self in a couple of years when I forget. Running on a Node server, look up npm scripts to build, test and run and look in package.json - if you wait two years again they probably need to be updated

Hosted on Netlify, might deply automatically from github but looks like something broke?
